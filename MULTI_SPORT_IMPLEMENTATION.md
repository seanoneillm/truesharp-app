## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Test mode with all sports
node scripts/odds-fetcher/main.js --test --league ALL

# Insert mode with specific sports
node scripts/odds-fetcher/main.js --insert --league MLB,NBA,NFL

# Use the comprehensive script
node scripts/fetch-all-sports.js --insert
```

### Frontend Usage
- Navigate to `/games` page
- Select any date using the date picker
- Click "Fetch Odds" to retrieve data for all sports
- Switch between league tabs to view different sports
- All leagues now load automatically on page load

## Database Schema Compatibility
- ✅ Existing `games` table supports all sports via `league` field
- ✅ Existing `odds` table handles all market types via flexible schema
- ✅ Foreign key relationships maintained (`eventid` → `games.id`)
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing MLB data

## Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Single API call with comma-separated leagues for efficiency
- ✅ Parallel frontend loading of multiple leagues
- ✅ Intelligent caching and error handling
- ✅ Rate limit detection and fallback mechanisms

## Testing Verification
- ✅ CLI help system works correctly
- ✅ Multi-league API calls function (rate limits expected in dev)
- ✅ Frontend loads and displays multi-league interface
- ✅ Database integration maintains compatibility
- ✅ Error handling gracefully manages missing data

## Next Steps for Production Use
1. **API Rate Limits**: Configure appropriate rate limiting for production
2. **Data Validation**: Add specific validation for each sport's unique data
3. **Market Parsing**: Implement sport-specific market parsing using reference file
4. **UI Enhancements**: Add sport-specific odds display components
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for multi-sport data flows
