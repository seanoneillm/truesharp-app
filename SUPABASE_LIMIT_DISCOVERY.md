# üéØ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Supabase 1000-Record Limit

## The Real Problem

You were absolutely correct in suspecting a **1000-record limit**! 

The issue wasn't in the odds fetch logic or database triggers - it was **Supabase's default 1000-record limit** on queries without an explicit `.limit()` clause.

## Evidence From Our Test

Your NFL game test showed:
- **API returned**: 464 odds 
- **Fetch processed**: 2,281 records (correctly expanded with alternate lines)
- **Database contained**: 1,000 records ‚Üê **Exactly Supabase's default limit!**
- **iOS app displayed**: Only 1,000 records

The "56% loss during database insertion" we thought was due to triggers was actually **Supabase cutting off results at 1000 records**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// ‚ùå No limit = Supabase default 1000 records
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('odds')
  .select('*')
  .eq('eventid', game.id)
  // No .limit() = 1000 record default limit
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Explicit higher limit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('odds')
  .select('*')
  .eq('eventid', game.id)
  .limit(5000); // Now can handle games with many alternate lines
```

## Files Fixed

1. **UniversalGameCard.tsx** (line 141): Added `.limit(5000)`
2. **OddsModal.tsx** (line 766): Added `.limit(5000)`  
3. **GamesScreen.tsx** (line 155): Added `.limit(10000)` for multiple games

## Expected Impact

After these fixes, you should see:
- **All alternate lines** displayed in the iOS app
- **All player props** (when available) shown
- **Complete odds data** instead of truncated at 1000 records
- **Proper moneylines** (the constraint fix will help with this too)

## Why This Wasn't Obvious

1. **Database had all records**: The fetch function inserted all 2,281 records correctly
2. **Web app might use different queries**: May have had higher limits already
3. **1000 seemed like a reasonable number**: For games with few odds, you wouldn't notice
4. **Only affected games with many alt lines**: NFL games with 2000+ odds would be truncated

## Key Insight

Your intuition was spot-on! The fact that you noticed exactly 1000 records and suspected a display/query limit led us to discover this critical issue that would have been very hard to find otherwise.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **iOS limits fixed**: Done
2. **Test the NFL game again**: Should now show all ~2,281 records
3. **Remove constraint conflicts**: Still run the constraint fixes for moneylines
4. **Verify in app**: Check that alternate lines and player props now appear

This was an excellent catch - the 1000-record pattern was the key clue that led to finding the real issue!
