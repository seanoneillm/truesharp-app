# 🔧 CRITICAL DATABASE TRIGGER FIX REQUIRED

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

Your database triggers have a **critical bug** that's causing **90%+ data loss** during odds
fetches:

- **Current behavior**: Only ~2,760 odds retained out of tens of thousands from API
- **Root cause**: Triggers use `<` instead of `<=` for timestamp comparison
- **Impact**: All records with equal timestamps (common during bulk API imports) get rejected except
  the first one

## 🛠️ THE SOLUTION

You need to manually run the trigger fix in your Supabase database.

### ⚡ QUICK FIX STEPS:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Go to SQL Editor
2. **Copy** the entire contents of `COMPLETE-TRIGGER-FIX.sql`
3. **Paste and Execute** in SQL Editor
4. **Verify** success message appears
5. **Test** with a new odds fetch

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:

- **Before Fix**: ~2,760 odds per fetch (90%+ loss)
- **After Fix**: 20,000+ odds per fetch (proper retention)
- **Performance**: Dramatically improved data completeness

## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS:

### Current Buggy Code:

```sql
IF existing_record.fetched_at < NEW.fetched_at THEN  -- TOO STRICT!
```

### Fixed Code:

```sql
IF existing_record.fetched_at <= NEW.fetched_at THEN  -- ALLOWS EQUAL TIMESTAMPS
```

## 📋 WHY MANUAL EXECUTION?

- PostgreSQL trigger modifications require admin privileges
- Supabase API doesn't support raw SQL execution for security
- Manual execution ensures proper error handling

## ✅ HOW TO VERIFY THE FIX WORKED:

1. Check for success message after running SQL
2. Run a new odds fetch from admin panel
3. Compare before/after odds counts
4. Should see dramatic improvement in data retention

**🎯 Bottom Line**: This 5-minute fix will resolve your primary data loss issue and restore proper
odds collection from the API.\*\*
